# Fundamentals
When referring to the .NET runtime, particularly .NET 5 and later versions, it encompasses several components that enable the execution of .NET applications. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### 1. **.NET Runtime Components:**

#### **CoreCLR (Core Common Language Runtime)**
- **CoreCLR.dll**: This is the core execution engine for .NET applications, handling tasks like memory management, thread management, and garbage collection.
- **clrjit.dll**: The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that translates the Intermediate Language (IL) code to native machine code at runtime.
- **mscorlib.dll** or **System.Private.CoreLib.dll**: Contains the fundamental classes and base types that are essential for any .NET application.

#### **CoreFX (Core Framework)**
- **System.*.dll**: A series of assemblies that provide the basic libraries and APIs for application development, such as System.Collections.dll, System.IO.dll, System.Net.Http.dll, etc.

### 2. **.NET SDK and Tooling:**

#### **dotnet CLI (Command Line Interface)**
- **dotnet.exe**: The command-line interface for .NET, used to build, run, and manage .NET applications and projects. This executable can also invoke the runtime to execute applications.

### 3. **Host and Bootstrapper:**
- **dotnet.exe** (also part of the runtime): Besides being the CLI, it also serves as the host that initializes the runtime, loads the necessary assemblies, and starts the application.

### 4. **Application Executables and Assemblies:**
- **App.dll**: The compiled output of your .NET application, containing the Intermediate Language (IL) code.
- **Other dependencies**: Any third-party or additional .NET assemblies your application depends on, such as Newtonsoft.Json.dll, etc.

### 5. **Additional Libraries:**
- **runtime-specific libraries**: These are native libraries specific to the runtime environment, such as runtime.linux-x64.Microsoft.NETCore.App, which provides native implementations for Linux x64.

### In Summary:

When we talk about the .NET runtime in the context of .NET 5 and later, we are referring to the core components that are essential for executing a .NET application. These include the core runtime libraries (CoreCLR and CoreFX), the dotnet executable (both CLI and host), and the necessary assemblies (both system-provided and application-specific) that make up and support a .NET application.

The typical .NET runtime includes:
- **dotnet.exe**: The command-line interface and host for running applications.
- **CoreCLR.dll** and associated JIT compiler **clrjit.dll**: The core execution engine.
- **System.Private.CoreLib.dll**: The core library containing base types.
- Various **System.*.dll** libraries providing standard .NET APIs.

This setup ensures that your .NET application can be compiled, executed, and managed effectively across different platforms supported by .NET 5 and later versions.

## Regarding mscorlib.dll and System.Private.CoreLib.dll
**mscorlib.dll** and **System.Private.CoreLib.dll** are both fundamental assemblies in the .NET ecosystem, but they serve different purposes and exist in different contexts. Here’s a detailed comparison:

### mscorlib.dll:

1. **Legacy Framework**: 
   - mscorlib.dll is a core library in the .NET Framework (versions 1.0 through 4.x).
   
2. **Content**:
   - It contains the core types such as `System.Object`, `System.String`, `System.Collections`, `System.IO`, and other foundational types and namespaces used throughout the .NET Framework.
   
3. **Usage**:
   - It is tightly coupled with the .NET Framework CLR (Common Language Runtime) and is loaded automatically by the runtime.
   - All .NET Framework applications reference mscorlib.dll implicitly.

4. **Platform**:
   - Primarily used in Windows environments where the .NET Framework is supported.

### System.Private.CoreLib.dll:

1. **Modern .NET**:
   - System.Private.CoreLib.dll is a core library in .NET Core and .NET 5+ (including .NET 6, .NET 7, and so on).

2. **Content**:
   - Similar to mscorlib.dll, it contains fundamental types like `System.Object`, `System.String`, `System.Collections`, and `System.IO`.
   - It is modularized and designed to be lightweight, which aligns with the modular architecture of .NET Core and .NET 5+.

3. **Usage**:
   - It is part of the .NET runtime and is implicitly referenced by .NET Core and .NET 5+ applications.
   - It plays a critical role in the runtime's implementation, encapsulating many of the base class libraries and runtime functionalities.

4. **Platform**:
   - Used across multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS, reflecting the cross-platform nature of .NET Core and .NET 5+.

### Key Differences:

1. **Framework Context**:
   - **mscorlib.dll** is specific to the .NET Framework (1.0-4.x), while **System.Private.CoreLib.dll** is used in .NET Core and .NET 5+.

2. **Modularity**:
   - **mscorlib.dll** is monolithic and part of the larger .NET Framework, whereas **System.Private.CoreLib.dll** is part of the modular and lightweight .NET Core and .NET 5+ runtime.

3. **Platform Support**:
   - **mscorlib.dll** is primarily for Windows, while **System.Private.CoreLib.dll** supports cross-platform development across Windows, Linux, and macOS.

4. **Development Philosophy**:
   - **mscorlib.dll** was designed for a monolithic framework where the entire runtime and libraries were shipped together.
   - **System.Private.CoreLib.dll** was designed with modern development practices in mind, focusing on modularity, performance, and cross-platform support.

In summary, mscorlib.dll is the core library for the legacy .NET Framework, while System.Private.CoreLib.dll is its counterpart in the modern, cross-platform .NET Core and .NET 5+ ecosystems. They both serve similar foundational purposes but are tailored for different runtime environments and development paradigms.
