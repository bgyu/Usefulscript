# Q: Show me the detailed process how app.exe loads app.dll?
# A:
Certainly! Here’s a detailed process of how `app.exe` loads `app.dll` in both a framework-dependent and self-contained .NET Core application:

### Framework-Dependent Application

#### Overview
In a framework-dependent application, `app.exe` is a small native executable that acts as a bootstrapper to load the .NET runtime and then load and execute the `app.dll`.

#### Detailed Process

1. **Execution Starts:**
   - The user executes `app.exe`.
   - The operating system loader loads `app.exe` into memory and starts execution.

2. **Locate and Initialize .NET Runtime:**
   - `app.exe` contains logic to locate the .NET Core runtime installed on the system. It uses environment variables, configuration files, or predefined paths to find the runtime.
   - It loads the `hostfxr.dll` (Host Resolver) from the global .NET installation directory.

3. **Hostfxr Initialization:**
   - `hostfxr.dll` initializes and determines the appropriate runtime version to use. It reads the `runtimeconfig.json` file (if present) or uses default settings.
   - `hostfxr.dll` locates and loads the `hostpolicy.dll`.

4. **Hostpolicy Initialization:**
   - `hostpolicy.dll` handles the probing and loading of the required .NET Core runtime components (`coreclr.dll` and other runtime dependencies).
   - It sets up the execution environment and prepares to load the managed entry point (the application’s main assembly, `app.dll`).

5. **Load and Execute app.dll:**
   - `hostpolicy.dll` loads `coreclr.dll` (the core runtime) and initializes the Common Language Runtime (CLR).
   - The CLR executes the managed code entry point, which is typically `Program.Main` in `app.dll`.

6. **Application Runs:**
   - The CLR starts executing the `Main` method in `app.dll`, and the application begins running.

### Self-Contained Application

#### Overview
In a self-contained application, `app.exe` includes the .NET Core runtime and all necessary dependencies. It does not rely on a globally installed runtime.

#### Detailed Process

1. **Execution Starts:**
   - The user executes `app.exe`.
   - The operating system loader loads `app.exe` into memory and starts execution.

2. **Embedded Runtime Initialization:**
   - `app.exe` includes the .NET Core runtime. It directly contains `hostfxr.dll`, `hostpolicy.dll`, `coreclr.dll`, and other runtime dependencies in the same directory or a subdirectory.

3. **Hostfxr Initialization:**
   - `app.exe` loads `hostfxr.dll` directly from its own directory.
   - `hostfxr.dll` initializes and prepares to load `hostpolicy.dll` from the same directory.

4. **Hostpolicy Initialization:**
   - `hostpolicy.dll` sets up the necessary runtime environment, loading `coreclr.dll` and other dependencies from the bundled files.

5. **Load and Execute app.dll:**
   - `hostpolicy.dll` loads `coreclr.dll` and initializes the CLR.
   - The CLR loads and executes the managed entry point in `app.dll`.

6. **Application Runs:**
   - The CLR starts executing the `Main` method in `app.dll`, and the application begins running.

### Summary of Key Steps

1. **Execution of `app.exe`:**
   - `app.exe` is launched by the OS.

2. **Initialization of Host Components:**
   - **Framework-Dependent:** Locates and initializes `hostfxr.dll` from the global .NET installation.
   - **Self-Contained:** Loads `hostfxr.dll` from the application's own directory.

3. **Loading of Hostpolicy:**
   - `hostfxr.dll` loads `hostpolicy.dll`.

4. **CLR Initialization:**
   - `hostpolicy.dll` loads `coreclr.dll` and initializes the CLR.

5. **Loading and Execution of app.dll:**
   - The CLR loads the entry point (`Main` method) from `app.dll` and starts the application.

# Q: Is there any setting or configuration to turn on the detailed logs to show me above loading process?
# A:
Yes, .NET Core provides mechanisms to enable detailed logging and diagnostics that can help you trace the loading process of your application, including how `app.exe` loads `app.dll`. You can use environment variables to control the verbosity of the logs and capture detailed information about the runtime initialization process. Here are the key settings and configurations you can use:

### Enabling Detailed Logs

#### 1. Setting Environment Variables

You can set several environment variables to enable detailed logging for the .NET Core host, runtime, and application. These variables can be set in your command line or added to your system environment variables.

- **`DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT`**: Opt-out of telemetry to avoid extra logs.
- **`COREHOST_TRACE`**: Enables detailed trace logging for the host (including `hostfxr` and `hostpolicy`).
- **`COREHOST_TRACEFILE`**: Specifies the file to which trace logs should be written.
- **`COREHOST_TRACE_VERBOSITY`**: Controls the verbosity of the trace logging.

#### Example Command Line Usage

```sh
# Enable detailed tracing
set COREHOST_TRACE=1

# Specify a trace log file
set COREHOST_TRACEFILE=corehost_trace.log

# Optionally, set verbosity (default is 4, which is the most verbose)
set COREHOST_TRACE_VERBOSITY=4

# Run your application
dotnet app.dll  # or ./app.exe
```

### Environment Variables Explained

1. **`COREHOST_TRACE`**: Setting this to `1` enables tracing for the .NET Core host components (`hostfxr` and `hostpolicy`). This will output detailed information about the loading process to the console.

2. **`COREHOST_TRACEFILE`**: By setting this variable, you can redirect the trace output to a specific file, which is useful for reviewing the logs later.

3. **`COREHOST_TRACE_VERBOSITY`**: This controls the verbosity level of the trace. The default is `4`, which provides the most detailed output. Lower values reduce the amount of detail.

### Sample Output

When you enable tracing, you will see detailed logs similar to the following:

```
--- Invoked apphost [version: 3.1.8, commit hash: 91ec14d4aa] main = {
dotnet
app.dll
}
Reading fx resolver directory=[C:\Program Files\dotnet\host\fxr]
Detected latest fxr version=[5.0.0]
Resolved fxr [%ProgramFiles%\dotnet\host\fxr\5.0.0\hostfxr.dll]...
Invoking fx resolver [%ProgramFiles%\dotnet\host\fxr\5.0.0\hostfxr.dll] hostfxr_main_startupinfo
...
```

### Using `dotnet` CLI Diagnostics Command

You can also use the `dotnet --info` command to get information about the .NET environment and SDK installations, which can be helpful in debugging issues related to runtime versions and configurations.

```sh
dotnet --info
```

### Summary

- **Enable Detailed Logging**: Set environment variables `COREHOST_TRACE`, `COREHOST_TRACEFILE`, and `COREHOST_TRACE_VERBOSITY`.
- **Run Application**: Use `dotnet app.dll` or `./app.exe` to see detailed logs.
- **Analyze Logs**: Review the output to understand the loading process of `app.exe` and `app.dll`.

By enabling these settings, you can obtain a comprehensive view of the .NET Core application loading process, which is invaluable for troubleshooting and understanding the runtime behavior.

This detailed process ensures that `app.dll` is correctly loaded and executed, providing a consistent startup mechanism for .NET Core applications in both framework-dependent and self-contained scenarios.
